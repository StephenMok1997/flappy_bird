## 🎯 About

Flappy Bird was a simple yet addictive game that became a viral sensation. This Flutter version recreates the core gameplay mechanics:

- Tap to flap the bird upward
- Avoid the pipes
- Try to get the highest score possible!

This project is built entirely with Flutter and is playable on both Android and iOS.
